            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>This website is a marriage of two things I enjoy: film and philosophy. Philosophy has always served as a medium for me to understand my life--and the media I consume--more clearly. Likewise, film has always helped me understand philosophical concepts more thoroughly. Over the past couple of years, I have been cultivaing a list of philosophical concepts I encounter in the movies I've seen. This website serves as a formal representation of the list. Access the complete list <a href="https://letterboxd.com/yvne/list/philosophical/">here.</a></p>

            <p>Yvonne Nguyen is a masters student studying UX Research & Design at the University of Michigan School of Information. She completed her undergraduate degree in Philosophy at UCLA. Her favorite movie genre is 'doomed romance'. She enjoys collecting smiskis and updating her Letterboxd in her free time.</p>
