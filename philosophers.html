				<h2>Martin Heidegger</h2>
				<p>Martin Heidegger was a German philosopher who is best known for his contributions to phenomenology, hermeneutics, and existentialism. He is often considered to be among the most important and influential philosophers of the 20th century.</p>
				<p>
                <h3>Notable Ideas</h3>
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Dasein</button>
				<div class="content">
                <p>Dasein is the primary object of investigation for Heidegger in <i>Being and Time</i>. The term is often translated as "being-there" or "being-here" and is a fundamental concept in existential philosophy. Heidegger states, “Dasein is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very Being, that Being is an <i>issue</i> for it” (<i>Being and Time</i> 4:32). It is important to note that Dasein is not a person (i.e., the philosophical conception of personhood) nor a biological human-being. Dasein is characterized by its 'modes-of-encounter', or ways of engaging, with the World and/or objects around it. </p>
				</div>

				<button type="button" class="collapsible">das Man</button>
				<div class="content">
                <p>One of the central concepts In Being and Time is Martin Heidegger’s treatment of authenticity. Heidegger asserts the default mode for human beings is to live what he describes as inauthentic. For example, rather than facing up to one’s own finitude—represented above all by the inevitability of death—human beings seek distraction and escape into moods such as curiosity, ambiguity, and idle talk. Heidegger characterized such conformity in terms of the notion of the anonymous das Man (“the They” or "the One").</p>

                <p>Das Man constitutes a possibility of Dasein's Being, and so das Man cannot be said to be any particular someone. Rather, the existence of 'the They' is known to us through, for example, linguistic conventions and social norms. Heidegger states that, "The "they" prescribes one's state-of-mind, and determines what and how one 'sees'".</p>

                <p>To give examples: when one makes an appeal to what is commonly known, one says "one does not do such a thing"; When one sits in a car or bus or reads a newspaper, one is participating in the world of 'the They'. This is a feature of 'the They' as it functions in society, an authority that has no particular source. In a non-moral sense Heidegger contrasts "the authentic self" ("my owned self") with "the they self" ("my un-owned self").</p>
				</div>

				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Being-towards-death</button>
				<div class="content">
                <p>Being-towards-death is illustrated as Dasein's relation to the possibility of one's own non-existence (or finitude). Heidegger argues that Being-towards-death has the three-dimensional character of care and is realized in both authentic and inauthentic modes.</p>
				<p>Authentic mode:</p>
				<p>Inauthentic mode:</p>

				<h2>Plato</h2>
				<p>Plato was an ancient Greek philosopher of the Classical period who is considered a foundational thinker in Western philosophy and an innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms. He raised problems for what became all the major areas of both theoretical philosophy and practical philosophy, and was the founder of the Platonic Academy, a philosophical school in Athens where Plato taught the doctrines that would later become known as Platonism.
